#Dice Problem - Calculate the number of ways to reach the given sum when dice is thrown once
sum = int(input())
dp = [0 for _ in range(sum+1)]
dp[0] = 1
for i in range(1,sum+1):
    for j in range(1,7):
        if i-j>=0:
            dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i-j]
print(dp[sum] , f'are, number of ways to reach {sum} when thrown a dice')
